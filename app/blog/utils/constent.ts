It Wasn't Just About Scoring High; It Was About Dedication

Hi, I'm Gaurav Narnaware. When I look back at my two and a half years of prep, the biggest lesson I learned is simple: dedication always trumps talent. I wasn't the smartest kid in the room, but I refused to give up. I decided to aim for a comprehensive victory, and I’m incredibly proud that I managed to conquer all major MBA Entrance Exams (CAT, XAT, SNAP, NMAT, MBA-CET) while simultaneously clearing the hurdles of Banking Exams (SBI PO, SBI Clerk) and even SSC-CGL.

In March 2025, that long journey paid off when I secured my admission to Symbiosis International. My scores reflect not brilliance, but consistency: 99.2%ile in MBA-CET, 97.6%ile in SNAP, 93.2%ile in XAT, and 87.6%ile in CAT.

When Life Hits Hard: Managing Crisis and Quants
If the exams were difficult, life’s timing was brutal. The true test of my resilience came when my father suffered a paralysis stroke. Suddenly, I wasn't just a student; I was a caregiver. I had to manage his health and my rigorous study schedule, and the emotional toll was immense.

Honestly, "The journey was like a rollercoaster." I poured in countless hours, only to see the results stay exactly the same. That’s when the self-doubt would creep in. I used to spend hours just thinking and talking to myself, often falling into overthinking spirals. But I realized that tendency to overthink was actually a strength—it meant I cared deeply. I channeled that analytical intensity into understanding every single aspect of my preparation and the complex situation I was in. That struggle to manage both roles is the real victory here.

The Strategy That Saved Me: My 4 Core Principles
1. Dig Deep on the Syllabus
2. The Mock-Test Reality Check
3. The Speed Hack (Easy Exams)
4. The Daily Task Diary—My Anchor

My Sanctuary: The Studyfi Advantage
When everything outside was chaos, I needed a place of peace. I have to credit the Studyfi Library for providing exactly that. Studyfi is truly one of the best libraries I’ve ever been to. The friendly environment and the dedicated space allowed me to maintain the intensity required.

My Final Word: Effort is Unintentional Hardwork
For anyone out there who belongs to a poor family or feels financially weak like I did, you haven't any excuses. There’s only one consistent message: give your 100% efforts. Whatever results you get, accept and move on. This success is a testament to the power of showing up, day after day, and pouring your whole self into the process.
